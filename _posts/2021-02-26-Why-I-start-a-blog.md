My PhD is the biggest task I ever tried to do, and thus I want to break it into several smaller parts. Many articles about accomplishing your PhD suggest that a blog could be helpful in the life of an assistant researcher.  

I hope that writing a blog supports many of my goals. For example, I should be able to practice my writing. My writing has lots of room for improvement and I would like to use at least 80% of my potential ([Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)). Writing, especially in academia is the main medium of communication. Not being able to communicate well is an obstacle I would like to overcome.  

Furthermore, writing a weekly blog forces me to achieve a "shippable" result every week. I expect this to be a curse and a blessing at the same time. On the one hand, I have to produce little results on a weekly basis and due to the time constraint I can explore topics less freely. On the other hand, I am forced to practice my writing which is a necessary part of my PhD journey.  

In addition, I would like to publish what I learn and contribute my perspective to the great learning resources the internet has to offer. Learning in public is uncomfortable for me, but I see benefits like a tighter feedback loop and the possibility to help someone else. What eases my discomfort is the imagination, that no one but my future self is going to read my "extended notes".
